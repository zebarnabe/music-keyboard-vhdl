Physical wiring for Casio SA-10

There is a single ribbon cable connecting the keyboard to the control board inside the SA-10

Keys are mapped in 4 blocks of 8, for a total of 32 keys, please note that black keys and white keys are treated the same.

The ribbon cable has 3 red insulated wires, the one that runs on the side of the ribbon cable is numbered as being output 1 and it is the left most key for the user of the keyboard in the 8 key blocks.

Mapping the keyboard band accordingly:

red   - output 1 
white - output 2
white - output 3
white - output 4
red   - output 5
white - input 1
white - input 2
white - input 3
white - input 4
red   - output 8
white - output 6
white - output 7

From left to right, to read the first 8 keys one drives the input 1 to high and the rest to zero. The outputs will be high if the key is pressed, low otherwise.

Considering the original audio created by the SA-10, the first white key is F3, so, when the input 1 is high the outputs will map the keys:

F3  - output 1
F3# - output 2
G3  - output 3
G3# - output 4
A4  - output 5
A4# - output 6
B4  - output 7
C4  - output 8

I think you can figure the rest out by now. ;)
